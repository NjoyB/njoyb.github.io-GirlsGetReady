    <h1> Tight Fitted Dresses </h1>
    <p>
      Really, any hairstyle looks cute with a tight fitted dress. 
      <br> 
      Wearing it down, or a cute style to go with your cute outfit,
      <br>
      but I think wearing your hair down, or in a slick back ponytail looks the best with a tight fitted dress.
