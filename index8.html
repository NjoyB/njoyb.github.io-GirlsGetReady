    <h1>Jean Jacket </h1>
    <p>
      Really, any hairstyle looks cute with a outfit that includes a jean jacket. 
      <br> 
      Wearing your curls down, or any other cute style to stand out from your outfit,

      but I think that a slick back ponytail looks the best with a outfit that includes a jean jacket.
